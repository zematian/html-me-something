                <p>I was born in Asamara, Eritrea in 1981 a small city in found in the horn of Africa. Eventhough Technology
                    and computer was my passion I did my undergradute degree in Physics due to limited resources that we
                    have backhome.</p>

                    While I was in Nairobi Kenya I tool SQL server 2012 (TSQL) which I enjoyed. When I came to US in 2015
                    I went to Newjercy and took some compyter courses and returned to st.Louis hoping to find a job. But
                    not having any US experince not helped me to find jobs easly. Finally I got a job with Clear sattelite
                    as an entern . Following year my freind who lives in Dallas found me a quality Analyst job with Samsung
                    as a contractor. </p>
